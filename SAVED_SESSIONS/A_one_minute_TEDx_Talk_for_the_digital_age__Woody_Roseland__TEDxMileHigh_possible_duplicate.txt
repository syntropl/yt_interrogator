[00h:00m:00s]  Transcriber: Victor Borges
Reviewer: David DeRuwe
[00h:00m:11s]  Wow,
[00h:00m:13s]  what an audience.
[00h:00m:14s]  But if I'm being honest,
I don't care what you think of my talk.
[00h:00m:18s]  I don't.
[00h:00m:19s]  I care what the internet
thinks of my talk.
[00h:00m:21s]  (Laughter)
[00h:00m:22s]  Because they are the ones
who get it seen and shared.
[00h:00m:24s]  And I think that's where
most people get it wrong.
[00h:00m:26s]  They're talking to you, here,
[00h:00m:28s]  instead of talking to you,
random person scrolling Facebook.
[00h:00m:34s]  Thanks for the click.
[00h:00m:36s]  You see, back in 2009,
[00h:00m:37s]  we all had these weird little things
called attention spans.
[00h:00m:41s]  (Laughter)
[00h:00m:42s]  Yeah, they're gone. They're gone.
We killed them. They're dead.
[00h:00m:46s]  I'm trying to think of the last time
I watched an 18-minute TED talk.
[00h:00m:50s]  It's been years, literally years.
[00h:00m:52s]  So if you're giving
a TED talk, keep it quick.
[00h:00m:55s]  I'm doing mine in under a minute.
[00h:00m:57s]  I'm at 44 seconds right now;
[00h:00m:59s]  that means we've got
time for one final joke.
[00h:01m:01s]  Why are balloons so expensive?
[00h:01m:04s]  (Audience) "Why?"
[00h:01m:05s]  Woody Roseland: Inflation.
[00h:01m:06s]  (Laughter)
[00h:01m:08s]  (Applause)
